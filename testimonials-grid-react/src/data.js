    been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who
    had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro
    course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
    The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my
    life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched
    careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.`,

    really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to
    be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
    junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the
    personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart
    and amazing people.`,

    subtitles: `
    Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I
    needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
    programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
    student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
    program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They
    were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.
    The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my
    learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever
    have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an
    example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a
    job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
    100% recommend!`,
